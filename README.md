## Final Insights 💡
- Since the launch, the number of Airbnbs has increased, and prices have risen due to initial traction and early adopters.
- As Airbnb became widely known, the number of listings increased, and prices decreased due to competition.
- After regulations were announced around 2015, there was underconfidence in the business; the number of Airbnbs decreased while prices increased.
- When regulations became the new normal in 2019, the number of Airbnbs grew, and prices decreased due to a larger supply.

### Recommendations for Airbnb:
1. Regulations in long-term rentals can negatively impact the business, potentially causing customer churn due to uncertainty.
2. Such regulations might lead to losses for Airbnb, which may be difficult to recover.
3. Negative customer experiences due to these regulations could harm Airbnb's brand perception.
4. Airbnb should monitor for similar regulations in other locations and proactively prepare for them.
5. Replicating regulation strategies across regions can help mitigate risks.
6. Introduce strict onboarding and offboarding rules for hosts to ensure quality.
7. Limit the number of Airbnbs in specific localities to maintain rental balance and avoid government intervention.
